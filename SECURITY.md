# Security

Paseo follows a client-server architecture, similar to Docker. The daemon runs on your machine and manages your coding agents. Clients (the mobile app, CLI, or web interface) connect to the daemon to monitor and control those agents.

Your code never leaves your machine. Paseo is a local-first tool that connects directly to your development environment.

## Architecture

The Paseo daemon can run anywhere you want to execute agents: your laptop, a Mac Mini, a VPS, or a Docker container. The daemon listens for connections and manages agent lifecycles.

Clients connect to the daemon over WebSocket directly.

## Local daemon trust boundary

By default, the daemon binds to `127.0.0.1`. The local control plane is trusted by network reachability, not by an additional authentication token.

Anything that can reach the daemon socket can control the daemon. This is the same security model Docker documents for its daemon: the security boundary is access to the socket or listening address.

If you expose the daemon beyond loopback, such as by binding to `0.0.0.0`, forwarding it through a tunnel or reverse proxy, or publishing it from a Docker container, you are responsible for restricting and securing that access.

Host header validation and CORS origin checks are defense-in-depth controls for localhost exposure. They help block DNS rebinding and browser-based attacks, but they do not replace network isolation.

## DNS rebinding protection

CORS is not a complete security boundary. It controls which browser origins can make requests, but does not prevent a malicious website from resolving its domain to your local machine (DNS rebinding).

Paseo validates the `Host` header on incoming requests against configured hostnames. Requests with unrecognized hosts are rejected.

## Agent authentication

Paseo wraps agent CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) but does not manage their authentication. Each agent provider handles its own credentials. Paseo never stores or transmits provider API keys. Agents run in your user context with your existing credentials.
